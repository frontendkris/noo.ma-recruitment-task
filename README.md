# Noo.ma Recruitment Task

This project is my submission for the Noo.ma recruitment process. It showcases a full-page layout with various interactive features of my idea.

## Demo

You can view a live demo of the project here: [Noo.ma Demo](https://noo-ma-recruitment-task.vercel.app/)

## Technology Stack

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: For adding type safety to the JavaScript code.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the application with utility-first CSS.
- **Vite**: For bundling the application with a modern, fast build tool.

## Design

You can check the design files in `/public/design` directory of the repository.

## Implementation Details

The project was designed to be a full-screen layout with appropriate margins, allowing the content to stretch across the entire page. Due to the unavailability of the project's original font file, I opted for the closest match available.

### Development Time

The core requirements (design) were implemented within 4.5 hours. An additional 3 hours were invested to add enhancements for the visual effects that deliver a sense of high interactivity and engagement.

### Enhancements

- **Entrance animtaion**: gallery up-slide animation for page load.
- **Image Reveal**: Images unveil as the user scrolls down, adding a dynamic feel to the gallery.
- **Smooth scroll to Gallery**: A feature that scrolls the user down to the gallery section upon unlocking.
- **Subtle Image Hovering**: Slight background enhancement for improved text readability.
- **Dynamic Glow Effect**: Based on mouse movement, this effect adds a layer of interactivity to the images.
- **Auto-Generated Content**: Titles and descriptions (on larger screens) are dynamically generated from file names.
- **Footer**: A simple footer to round off the page.

These features are implemented to not only capture the user's attention but also to create a memorable and engaging user experience.

## Conclusion

While the project might seem modest, it incorporates a range of features intended to demonstrate both functionality and creativity.
